# scatter plot : Scatter plots are graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane
plt.scatter(x,y)

# histogram plot

df['price_binned'] = pd.cut(df['Price'], bins, labels = group_names, include_lowest = True)

# bar plot, x is the categorical variable, and height is the number of values belonging to the category. You can adjust the width of each bin using an additional width argument in the function
plt.bar(x,height)

# Pseudo Color Plot
plt.pcolor(C) # c is matrix of the pivot table data

# regression plot
sns.regplot(x = 'header_1',y = 'header_2',data= df)

# boxplot : to see outliers while d is 1 column of the data sets
plt.boxplot(d)

# residual plot : A residual plot is used to display the quality of polynomial regression.
sns.residplot(data=df,x='header_1', y='header_2') #or
